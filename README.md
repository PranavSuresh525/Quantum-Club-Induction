# Quantum-Club-Induction
I have attached the PS1 code with this repository. I have created a class to which describes all the operations in a qubit. I have defined each gate allong with its corresponding matrix. By importing numpy I am able to manupilate the matrices.The first function inside class is to create a matrix that describes the qubit. the function creates an 2^n by 1 matrix where n is the number of qubits. I have set the qubit to start as |00>. The apply gate function checks which qubit you want it to act on. If it is qubit 1 ( index[0] ) then it applies the kron product, i.e the Tensor product on qubit 1. This is mathematically gate ⊗ I. If it nneds to act on the second qubit ( index[1] ) it will apply I⊗gate. If the the function is a 2 qubit function, it checks the state the qubit is in and proceeds to apply a simple if else depending to on the control qubit. To swap the qubit value we first swap the postion of q1 and q2 then apply the gate to q2 then proceed to swap it back to return it to its original position. The last function is to measure the probabilities of each qubit. we just square the the eigen values for each qubit. then normalise it. we then return the value corresponding to the value picked by the normal function. since it pick a random number from 1-n we then need to convert it to dirac notation by converting it to binary. Thus we are able to create a program which can apply the gates
